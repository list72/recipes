<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>500 grams of raw pre-shelled peanuts</li>

    <li>Spread peanuts on a large baking sheet and roast in the oven at 175Â°C for ten to twelve minutes</li>
    <li>While the peanuts are still hot remove any skins from them. This is best done by wrapping a few handfuls at a time in a dish towel and rolling them against each other for several seconds.</li>
    <li>Put all your roasted and skinned peanuts in a food processor, add salt if desired, and chop until you have reached your desired thickness of peanut butter. (This may take a few minutes)</li>
